*Write your first program in Kotlin*

**What is Kotlin?**<br>
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
Android apps are written in the Kotlin programming language. Kotlin is a modern language created to help developers write code efficiently and with as few errors as possible.

**Programming Language?**<br>
Just like you use human language to communicate with another person, you use a programming language to communicate with the operating system of your computer. Fortunately, programming languages are less complex than human languages and quite logical!

**(IDE) Integrated Development Environment**<br>
IDE is a programming tool or software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
we can simply say that IDE is use as a code editor.


In your browser, open https://developer.android.com/training/kotlinplayground. This will opens a browser-based programming tool.<br>
OR<br>
Clone this project in android studio and navigate to the kotline playground Git: https://github.com/mustafakamal88/KotlinPlayGround.git<br>

**This is the program code in the editor:**<br>
```
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```
<br>

**Run the program code**<br>
Running a program that you created is not much different than running a program such as a word processor on your computer. The difference is that when you run a program to accomplish a task, or play a game, you primarily care about what the program can do for you, and you don't concern yourself with the code that makes it work. When you are programming, you get to see and work with the actual code that makes the magic happen.<br>

Let's see what this program does!<br>

In the editor, in the top-right corner, find the green triangle and click it to run the program.
Look at the pane at the bottom.<br>

**Output**<br>

Hello, world!<br>

**Notice** Hello, world! printed, So now you know what this program does: It prints, or outputs, a hello world message.


**Compilation:** is a process that translates the Kotlin program code into a form that the system can run. If compilation completes successfully, there are no errors in the program that would keep it from running. If there are problems, they will appear in the pane at the bottom.
